# Instagram extractor
Download photos and videos from public accounts from Instagram.

## Requirements
`pip install -r requirements.txt`, or equivalently 

    pip install selenium
    pip install wget

Additionaly, you have to install the driver ([geckodriver](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases)) to handle the web browser. In this case, Firefox is the webbrowser being used, so you have to install geckodriver and add it to your path. For Linux, extract the file with `tar -xf` and move it to `/usr/local/bin/` or `/usr/bin/`.
